# RenChat for Android

A secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth mesh networks. No internet required, no servers, no phone numbers - just pure encrypted communication.

**üÜï Latest Features (v1.0.0 Compatible):**
- **Individual chat locking** with PIN/biometric authentication
- **Enhanced IRC commands** with full validation (/help, /nick, /me, /list, /leave, /topic)
- **Location-based channels** using geohash for local area communication
- **Nostr integration** for location channels with relay support
- **Improved UI/UX** with repositioned controls and enhanced scrolling
- **Enhanced security** with biometric authentication and robust nickname handling

This is the **Android port** of the original [RenChat iOS app](https://github.com/jackjackbits/BitChat), maintaining 100% protocol compatibility for cross-platform communication.

## üì± **BitChat ‚Üí RenChat Evolution**

**RenChat** is the modern evolution of BitChat with significant UI/UX improvements while maintaining full protocol compatibility:

### **What Changed:**
- **üé® Modern UI Design**: WhatsApp-inspired interface replacing terminal-style green theme
- **üñºÔ∏è New Branding**: Updated logo, icons, and app identity
- **üì± Enhanced UX**: Smooth animations, better typography, improved responsiveness
- **üë• Advanced Group System**: WhatsApp-like group management with invite URLs, admin roles, and comprehensive controls
- **üîí Same Security**: Identical encryption and mesh networking protocols

### **What Stayed the Same:**

## üîí View Once Messages

RenChat now supports **view-once messages** - a privacy-focused feature that automatically deletes messages after they're viewed once by recipients.

### How It Works

- **Auto-Delete**: Messages disappear after being viewed once by recipients
- **Cross-Platform**: Fully compatible with iOS RenChat via binary protocol
- **Universal**: Works in both private chats and group channels
- **Sender Visibility**: Senders can always see their own view-once messages

### Using View Once Messages

1. **Enable View Once Mode**: 
   - Look for the lock button next to the send button
   - Tap to toggle view-once mode
   - **Gray lock** = View once disabled (normal messages)
   - **Green lock** = View once enabled (disappearing messages)

2. **Send View Once Messages**:
   - Type your message as usual
   - Enable view-once mode (lock button turns green)
   - Send your message - it will show a small lock icon

3. **Viewing View Once Messages**:
   - Recipients see view-once messages with a lock indicator
   - Once viewed, the message disappears from recipient's chat
   - Senders retain visibility of their own view-once messages

### Technical Details

- **Protocol Compatibility**: View-once state transmitted via binary protocol
- **Message Tracking**: App tracks which view-once messages have been viewed
- **Visual Indicators**: Lock icons clearly identify view-once messages
- **State Management**: View-once mode persists during chat session

### Getting Started

1. **Install the app** on your Android device (requires Android 8.0+)
2. **Grant permissions** for Bluetooth and location when prompted
3. **Launch RenChat** - it will auto-start mesh networking
4. **Set your nickname** or use the auto-generated one
5. **Connect automatically** to nearby iOS and Android RenChat users
6. **Join a channel** with `/j #general` or start chatting in public
7. **Messages relay** through the mesh network to reach distant peers

### Android UI Features

- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Modern Material Design 3 interface
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Terminal-inspired aesthetic matching iOS
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibrations for interactions and notifications
- **Adaptive Layout**: Optimized for various Android screen sizes
- **Message Status**: Real-time delivery and read receipts
- **RSSI Indicators**: Signal strength colors for each peer

## Security & Privacy

### Encryption
- **Private Messages**: X25519 key exchange + AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Channel Messages**: Argon2id password derivation + AES-256-GCM
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for message authenticity
- **Forward Secrecy**: New key pairs generated each session

### Privacy Features
- **No Registration**: No accounts, emails, or phone numbers required
- **Ephemeral by Default**: Messages exist only in device memory
- **Cover Traffic**: Random delays and dummy messages prevent traffic analysis
- **Emergency Wipe**: Triple-tap logo to instantly clear all data
- **Local-First**: Works completely offline, no servers involved

## Performance & Efficiency

### Message Compression
- **LZ4 Compression**: Automatic compression for messages >100 bytes
- **30-70% bandwidth savings** on typical text messages
- **Smart compression**: Skips already-compressed data

### Battery Optimization
- **Adaptive Power Modes**: Automatically adjusts based on battery level
  - Performance mode: Full features when charging or >60% battery
  - Balanced mode: Default operation (30-60% battery)
  - Power saver: Reduced scanning when <30% battery
  - Ultra-low power: Emergency mode when <10% battery
- **Background efficiency**: Automatic power saving when app backgrounded
- **Configurable scanning**: Duty cycle adapts to battery state

### Network Efficiency
- **Optimized Bloom filters**: Faster duplicate detection with less memory
- **Message aggregation**: Batches small messages to reduce transmissions
- **Adaptive connection limits**: Adjusts peer connections based on power mode

## Technical Architecture

### Binary Protocol
RenChat uses an efficient binary protocol optimized for Bluetooth LE:
- Compact packet format with 1-byte type field
- TTL-based message routing (max 7 hops)
- Automatic fragmentation for large messages
- Message deduplication via unique IDs

### Mesh Networking
- Each device acts as both client and peripheral
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management
- Store-and-forward for offline message delivery
- Adaptive duty cycling for battery optimization

### Android-Specific Optimizations
- **Coroutine Architecture**: Asynchronous operations for mesh networking
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Thread-safe concurrent mesh operations
- **EncryptedSharedPreferences**: Secure storage for user settings
- **Lifecycle-Aware**: Proper handling of Android app lifecycle
- **Battery Optimization**: Foreground service and adaptive scanning
